You are in space. You are weightless, but you can grab and throw yourself around. Other people are there, but they have a bad case of the flu, so you'll have to maintain proper distancing. Also, the oxygen is running out. Better get to the next room.

Inputs are mouse+LMB: hold down LMB as you are approaching walls to grab, then release to throw yourself in the direction towards the cursor.

Can restart the current level by using the 'R' key.
